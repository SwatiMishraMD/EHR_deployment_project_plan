# EHR implementation and deployment project
This project takes a hypothetical scenario of Virginia Women's Center (VWC), a clinical setup with multiple locations, that wants to move from a paper-based workflow to EHR. The project considers relevant EHR standards, federal program incentives like MIPS, certified EHR requirements, and VWCs workflow processes and business requirements.

The project is an end-to-end high-level project plan discussing 
1. Project goals
2. Team members
3. Mapping existing clinical workflows to EHR processes
4. Mapping business requirements of the healthcare setup to EHR functionalities, so that system requirements can be decided.
5. Interoperability requirements with existing systems.
6. EHR technical infrastructure with its diagram
7. Project risks
